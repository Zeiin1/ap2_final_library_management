## Project relevance
The Library Management System is an essential 
tool that helps to manage various library operations 
effectively. With the increasing demand for 
digitalization and technology, it is essential 
to have a system that simplifies the library 
operations and improves the user experience. 
This project was chosen as it is relevant to 
the current scenario and provides a solution 
that will help the libraries in Kazakhstan to 
manage their operations more efficiently.

## Analysis of competitors
There are several library management systems 
available in Kazakhstan, such as Librarika, 
Koha, and Library Management System (LMS). 
However, our app aims to provide unique features 
that can compete with these projects. 
Our app will have a user-friendly interface,
customizable options, online payment features, 
and integration with other software. These 
features will make our app more competitive in 
the market and provide a better user experience.

## Project auditory
The target audience for our app is libraries in 
Kazakhstan. Our app is designed to meet the needs 
of libraries of all sizes, including academic, 
public, and private libraries. The app will provide
a solution that will simplify library operations
and improve the user experience for library patrons.

## Project features
* User-friendly interface: The app will have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that will make it easy for library staff to manage library operations.
* Customizable options: The app will allow libraries to customize the system based on their requirements, such as adding or removing features, changing the layout, and more.
* Integration with other software: The app will integrate with other software commonly used in libraries, such as cataloging software, to provide a seamless experience.

## Built With
* Go
* PostgreSQL
